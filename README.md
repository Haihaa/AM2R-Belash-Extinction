# AM2R-Belash-Extinction
Custom campaign mod for AM2R.
Belash Extinction is a challenge mod with a custom map solely about bossfights and combat, as well as introducing new mechanics and ways to approach bosses, as well as bring to life some interesting concepts thought of by other modders and Metroid fans.

Walljumping will be an essential skill, as well as past experience playing Metroid games on their hardest difficulty (a good place to start would be AM2R on Hard or Fusion difficulty.)

Other skills required include bomb-jumping, shinesparking (mid-air and standing) and machballing/speedballing.

PALLETES?
Each boss has their own palette image that can be edited by you if you wish to easily repalette them. It is recommended you use an image editor that can replace every pixel and uses layers.
To access the Custom Palette menu for bosses, press F1 in the game menu. Alternate between custom and original boss palettes. (Ensure DirectX9.0 is installed.)
Custom palettes made by me (ssanoo) have already been added, but feel free to make and share your own. Whichever palette you choose to play with will most likely not matter on any playthrough.
